## 1. Summary

( 💻 Dev | Design 🎨 ) { 💙 Flutter | Dart 🎯 } { 💾 TypeScript JS | HTML CSS 🖌 }

I'm currently a solo developer creating apps and websites with Flutter, Dart, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I also have experience with Docker, Python, Django, Kubernetes and some other stuff. However for most of these I would have to dust off my knowledge before fully using it back again.

I'm a Brazilian native, so I speak Portuguese, but I also speak English and French.

## 2. My Published/Open Software

So far, as published/open software, I have:

- [YouTube Keyboard Navigation Extension][youtube_kbd_nav]: a browser extension which adds keyboard shortcuts to YouTube's browser UI.
    - Made with Dart 🎯
    - Quite stable, I use it on a daily basis. It still conflicts with some of YouTube's UI, but this problem is quite minimal.
    - Currently working with Chrome, Edge and Firefox, though full support for Firefox won't be maintained.
- [OGS Keyboard Navigation Extension][ogs_kbd_nav]: a browser extension for playing go on [OGS][ogs] with only the keyboard.
    - Made with TypeScript.
    - It offers a way of navigating the online Goban with your arrow keys or typing in the coordinates.

## 3. Contributions

- [Fast Immutable Collections][fast_immutable_collections]: Immutable collections for Dart, which are also faster than its competitors, like [kt_dart][kt_dart] and [built_collection][built_collection].
    - [@marcglasberg][marcglasberg] asked me if I wanted to participate in his project as a contributor. Almost all of the key ideas are his.
    - Should be done in the next few weeks at most.

## 5. Other Stuff

My interests are random and feature a wide variety of topics, something I've been unambiguously complimented on and criticized for. If you want to know more, do check my website out: [fanaro.com.br][my_website].

Another major on-and-off interest of mine is in the game of ○● [Go][go_wikipedia] ●○ (Baduk or Weiqi (囲碁 or 바둑 or 围棋)). I have some articles about it in my website and have some videos on my YouTube channel as well &mdash; the videos are in Portuguese.
