## 1. Summary

> Visit my website: [fanaro.io][fanaro.io]

I'm currently a solo developer creating apps and websites with Flutter, Dart, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I also have experience with Docker, Python, Django, Kubernetes and some other stuff. However for most of these I would have to dust off my knowledge before fully using it back again.

> Currently, I've been studying a lot of Haskell and functional programming.

I'm a Brazilian native, so I speak Portuguese, but I also speak English and French.

> My daily driver is Artix, a distro based on Arch Linux, you can check out [my dotfiles][dotfiles]. I still have some software dependencies &mdash; addictions? &mdash; on Windows though, mostly due to working with others..

## 2. My Published/Open Software

So far, as published/open software, I have:

- [<img alt="fanaro.io" width="15px" src="assets/logo.png"/>][fanaro.io] [fanaro.io][fanaro.io]: my blog, a place for UI/UX experimentation with the simplest and most effective designs for reading, and also for sharing my hopefully helpful world view.
  - The most prominent topics are: [Go][go_wikipedia], programming, productivity, design and psychology.
- [<img alt="YouTube Kbd Nav" width="16px" src="assets/youtube_kbd_nav.svg"/>][youtube_kbd_nav] [YouTube Keyboard Navigation Extension][youtube_kbd_nav]: a browser extension which adds keyboard shortcuts to YouTube's browser UI.
  - Made with Dart 🎯
  - Quite stable, I use it on a daily basis. It still conflicts with some of YouTube's UI, but this problem is quite minimal.
  - Currently working with Chrome, Edge and Firefox, though full support for Firefox won't be maintained.
- [<img alt="OGS Kbd Nav" width="16px" src="assets/ogs_kbd_nav.svg"/>][ogs_kbd_nav] [OGS Keyboard Navigation Extension][ogs_kbd_nav]: a browser extension for playing go on [OGS][ogs] with only the keyboard.
  - Made with TypeScript.
  - It offers a way of navigating the online Goban with your arrow keys or typing in the coordinates.

## 3. Co-Authorship

- [<img alt="Fast Immutable Collections" height="13px" src="assets/fic_logo.png"/>][fast_immutable_collections] [Fast Immutable Collections][fast_immutable_collections]: Immutable collections for Dart, which are also faster than its competitors, like [kt_dart][kt_dart] and [built_collection][built_collection].
  - [@marcglasberg][marcglasberg] asked me if I wanted to participate in his project as a contributor. Almost all of the key ideas are his.
  - It features a benchmark app so you can compare it to its competitors.
  - [Here][fanaro.io_fic] is the article on my website.

## 4. Other Projects

- [Fanaro's Sabaki Theme Collection][sabaki_themes]: a collection of themes and helpful documentation for creating themes for the SGF Go editor [Sabaki][sabaki].
- [Como Jogar Go &mdash; Uma Introdução Concisa](https://github.com/FanaroEngineering/traducao_como_jogar_go): the translation of Kiseido's Book [How to Play Go &mdash; A Concise Introduction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35663792-how-to-play-go-a-concise-introduction?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=BPOysUtlJm&rank=1), by Richard Bozulich and James Davies. Everything in that project is open source, done with LaTeX and [GoWrite2](http://gowrite.net/GOWrite2_download.html), so, in case you would like to know how a Go book *can* be made, there it is.
- [DOGemP's Flutter Website](https://github.com/FanaroEngineering/dogemp): a front-end, made with Flutter for the online dojo I created. This is a side project mostly used for derusting my Flutter abilities.
- [How to write your own Go ebook](https://github.com/psygo/template_tsumego_ebook): using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [GoWrite2](http://gowrite.net/GOWrite2_download.html).

## 6. My Competences

A fairly comprehensive and entertaining list of my competences can be found on my website [here](https://fanaro.io/competences.html).

## 7. Some Statistics about My Work

Here are some statistics about my work on Github:

<img
  src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=psygo&show_icons=true&theme=algolia"
  alt="Github Statistics about the user psygo"
/>

My top language should be Dart &mdash; at least at the date I mentioned above &mdash;, but I've mostly written in it for other people, so this is what you get:

<img
  src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=psygo&theme=algolia&hide=jupyter%20notebook,html"
  alt="Top languages from user psygo"
/>

Maybe it's more accurate to classify my language interests at the moment with a chart for the last week:

## 8. Other Stuff

My interests are random and feature a wide variety of topics, something I've been unambiguously complimented on and criticized for. If you want to know more, do check my website out: [fanaro.io][fanaro.io].

Another major on-and-off interest of mine is in the game of ○● [Go][go_wikipedia] ●○ (Baduk or Weiqi (囲碁 or 바둑 or 围棋)). I have some articles about it in my website and have some videos on my YouTube channel as well &mdash; the videos are in Portuguese.
